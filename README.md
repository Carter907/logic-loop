## Logic-Loop
---
This app allows you to study propositional logic using noval questions without end!

### How does it work?
---
An Ollama local model (Meta AI's llama3 for instance) is constantly prompted for quesiton details even before you hit the next button.
Once these question objects are created they are stored in a queue and the ui is updated accordingly.

### Goal
---
To create a continuous content system using LLMs.

Please refer to the wiki for more information about the project design and development goals.
