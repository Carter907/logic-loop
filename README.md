## Prop-Logic-Mastery

This app allow you to study your discrete math using noval questions without end!

### How does it work?

An Ollama local model (Meta AI's llama3 for instance) is constantly prompted for quesiton details even before you hit the next button.
Once these question objects are created they are stored in a queue and the ui is updated accordingly.

### What are some reasons for this project.

I wanted to find some novel way of apply Large Language Models to a website that I have seen done before. A thought came to me after some time. What if I could use an LLM along with Spring Boot to continuously create
new content based on user input. This app was born as a result.
